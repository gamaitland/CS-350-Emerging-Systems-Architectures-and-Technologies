The final project was created to use our microcontroller as a thermostat. This thermostat has a predefined temperature set point, and users can increase or decrease the temperature by using the two buttons on the board. The red LED illuminates to indicate that the heat is on, thus turning up the temperature. It turns to indicate that the temperature is decreasing to cool.

The Morse Code assignment is intended to be a morse code transmitter. This project illuminates the green and red LEDs in a series of dots and dashes to communicate SOS or OK based on a button push.

For both projects, I think that I strategized well on what needed to be accomplished. I had a good understanding of what the projects were asking me for, and I was able to accomplish some of these things on my own.

However, I could improve on turning my strategies into actual code. Some things were easy for me to code with help from reading materials from zyBooks, but I had to use other resources to code other things like state machines and task managers. 

Because of this class, I am adding embedded systems coding to my support network, as well as additional resources through zyBooks, YouTube, and other embedded systems users from GitHub.

Out of the aforementioned, embedded systems coding may be the most transferrable as it is based on the C language, which is still widely used today. In fact, there are very little differences between Embedded C and C.

These projects are readable, maintainable, and adaptable due to detailed comments, attributions to source codes, and functions and variables that can reused easily.
